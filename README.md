# TypeScript Type Error Bug

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error that occurs when passing an argument of an incorrect type to a function.

The `bug.ts` file contains a function `add` which is designed to add two numbers. However, in the usage example, we attempt to pass a string as one of the arguments which leads to a type error during compilation.

The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to fix this error by ensuring that the correct type of arguments is passed to the function. 

This example highlights the importance of type safety in TypeScript and demonstrates how the compiler helps in identifying such errors during development.
